--------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
    
    @Continuation:
        - s_CON_gatekeeper:
            --> opt_cont.mu_limit now must be a vector of increasing numerical values (xlim(mu_limit) does not work in contplot otherwise) (lines 26 - 30 added)

    @DynamicalSystem:
        - DynamicalSystem:
            --> Version number corrected to 3.0 (line 10)

    @SOL_QPS_FDM:
        - evalsol_hypertime: 
            --> When dim = 1, the Z coordinates are not transponsed anymore by the permute function (former line 84)
            --> An exception has been added: no permutation is required when dim = 1 (lines 84 - 88)

    @ST_PS_SHM:
        - PS_SHM_calc_stability_auto:
            --> Computation of monodromy matrix corrected: Exception for n_shoot = 1 added (lines 47 - 54)
        - PS_SHM_calc_stability_non_auto:
            --> Computation of monodromy matrix corrected: Exception for n_shoot = 1 added (lines 47 - 54)
        - s_ST_PS_SHM_gatekeeper:
            --> "opt_approx_method" corrected to "opt_stability" in lines 61 and 61

    Functions:
        - initial_solution:
            --> Spaces in "header" of CoSTAR display output adapted to new version number 3.0: two spaces have been added in line 14

    Tutorials:
        - Info text for new restriction of opt_cont.mu_limit (must be a vector of increasing numerical values) added to following tutorials:
            --> Tutorial_EQ
            --> Tutorial_PS_FDM     --> Tutorial_PS_FGM     --> Tutorial_PS_SHM
            --> Tutorial_QPS_FDM    --> Tutorial_QPS_FGM    --> Tutorial_QPS_SHM
          

----------  

The presentation has been updated: a slide containing publications has been added as third slide.
