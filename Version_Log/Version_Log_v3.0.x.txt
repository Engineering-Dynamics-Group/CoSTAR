--------------------------------------------

Stability computation added for quasi-periodic solutions approximated by Finite Difference Method or Fourier-Galerkin Method.
Similar to stability computation of periodic solutions, a converged solution is "reshooted" using the quasi-periodic shooting method ...
to obtain the mapping matrices from the Jacobian of the shooting algorithm.
Moreover, it is now possible to define the number of characteristics for reshooting a solution (this is also possible when shooting ...
is already used as approximation method) and the number of mappings to calculate the Ljapunov exponents.
