            --> Error control: A solution with decreased discretization is not accepted now if the new error is above the limit (lines 192 - 207). Also added dynamic saving of some AM properties (lines 140 - 143)
            --> Splitted the elseif block "In-/Decrease of discretization failed" and changed the flag for "Increase failed" from 0 to -1 (lines 228 - 230 and 263, 251 - 258 added)
            --> Added elseif blocks for the case "Increasing not possible: Maximum discretization reached" (lines 233 - 240) and changed the flag for "Decreasing not possible" from -1 to 2 (line 243)
            --> Changed some "header" comments to begin with "%%" in order to increase oversight and structure of the function by introducing MATLAB sections (lines 22, 62, 79, 112, 124, 288, 311, 322 and 336)

    test:

            --> Continuation 2: Changed the 'display' option from 'iter' to 'error-control' to test the error control output (line 46)

        - test_FGM_PS_vdP
            --> Continuation 3: Changed the value of 'n_fft' from 2^6 to 2^4 and added rigorous error limits to test the algorithms of in- and decreasing n_fft (line 55)
            --> Continuation 3: Changed options.opt_init to only have 4 harmonics in order to test the new algorithms (line 57)
        - test_FGM_PS_duffing
            --> Changed the value of 'n_fft' from 2^6 to 2^3 to test the algorithms of increasing n_fft (line 43)

------------------ v3.1.7 ------------------
--------------------------------------------

FGM and SHM: It is now possible to set the contplot/solplot/solget field 'resolution' as a [1x2] array for quasi-periodic hypertime plots.
Changes affect:

    @SOL_QPS_FGM:
        - evalsol_hypertime:
            --> Restructured the method a bit and adapted some comments
            --> Added support to accept a [1x2] array as well as a scalar for options.resolution (lines 18 - 24 and 63)
            --> Some more variables are initialized to avoid calling obj in the loop. The hypertime values are also initialized before the loop now (lines 30 - 42 and 58)
            --> The loop is now for k = i:n_evals instead of k = index (lines 46, 48 - 50, 53, 54)

    @SOL_QPS_SHM:
        - evalsol_hypertime:
            --> Restructured the method: Removed unnecessary variables and array dimensions, realigned the comments and rearranged some code (-> that is why no lines are specified for the following subitems)
            --> Added support to accept a [1x2] array as well as a scalar for options.resolution
            --> Some more variables are initialized to avoid calling obj in the loop. The hypertime values are also initialized before the loop now
            --> The loop is now for k = i:n_evals instead of k = index
            --> The interpolation at the boundaries is now done within the "main" loop and not in a second loop 

    @Solution:
        - contplot_gatekeeper:
            --> Removed the constraint that a [1x2] array for the field 'resolution' is only allowed if the FDM was used (lines 76 and 77)
        - s_help_contplot:
            --> Updated the description of the field 'resolution' (line 26)
        - s_help_solget:
            --> Updated the description of the field 'resolution' (lines 44 and 45)
        - s_help_solplot:
            --> Updated the description of the field 'resolution' (lines 54 and 55)
        - solget_gatekeeper:
            --> Removed the constraint that a [1x2] array for the field 'resolution' is only allowed if the FDM was used (lines 59 and 60)
        - solplot_gatekeeper:
            --> Removed the constraint that a [1x2] array for the field 'resolution' is only allowed if the FDM was used (lines 85 and 86)

    test/01postprocessing:
        - benchmark_postprocess_quasiperiodic:
            --> Changed, added or removed the field 'resolution' here and there to test all possible cases: no value, scalar, vector (lines 36, 39, 56, 59 and 62)

    Tutorials:
        - Tutorial_Postprocessing_contplot:
            --> Updated the description of the field 'resolution'
        - Tutorial_Postprocessing_solget:
            --> Updated the description of the field 'resolution'
        - Tutorial_Postprocessing_solplot:
            --> Updated the description of the field 'resolution'
     
    
----------  
   
Periodic shooting method: It is now possible to define the opt_init field 'ic' as [dim*n_shoot_ic x 1] vector. 
If the number of shooting points (state space values) in the opt_init-field 'ic' is not equal to one or does not match the desired number of shooting points n_shoot,
the given shooting points in 'ic' are interpolated to obtain the desired shooting points. Changes affect:

    @AM_PS_SHM:
        - getIV:
            --> Renamed z0 to s0 (line 15 and other)
            --> Restructured the method: Removed the ifelse-block for n_auto == 1 since code was almost identical to the case n_auto == 0. Adapted this case to work for n_auto == 1 as well
            --> Added if-ifelse-block for the case numel(s0) == dim to get the correct periodic time (lines 22 - 27)
            --> Added else-block for the case that n_shoot_ic is not equal to one or to n_shoot (lines 44 - 54)
            --> If system is autonomous, the autonomous frequency is now added at the end of the method (lines 59 - 63)
        - s_help_opt_init_PS_SHM:
            --> Updated the general info (lines 11 and 13 - 15)
            --> Updated the value and text of the field 'ic' (lines 18 and 20 - 22)
        - s_PS_SHM_gatekeeper
            --> Check of correct number of elements of field 'ic' replaced by the check that numel(ic)/dim is an integer (lines 70 - 76 replaced by lines 70 - 73)

    test:
        - test_SHM_PS_duffing:
            --> For the continuation, the method solution vector of the previously computed single solution is used as 'ic' to test the new code (line 39)
        - test_SHM_PS_duffing:
            --> For the continuation, the method solution vector of the previously computed single solution is used as 'ic' to test the new code (line 34)
