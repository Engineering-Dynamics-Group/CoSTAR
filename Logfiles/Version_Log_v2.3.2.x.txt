Log of different Code Versions of branch V2.1.2.x 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%% CHANGES TO EXISTING CODE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
V2.3.2.1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1) Stability class: 	Added a sort_multipliers function for generalizing the sorting process. 
					Added the sort_multipliers functionality to the calc_stability functions of the different subclasses 
					Extended curve container with the multipliers and the number of unstable values
					Added the function periodic_test_functions in ST_PS_Shoot. This is a static method since this method should also be called by the Hill method
					Added the test_function property in Stability master class
					Added an assignment of the test_function property in the s_stability_selection static method
					Extended the curve container for the test_functions.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1) costaropts:		costaropts now finds automatically doubled fieldnames and throws an error.

V2.3.2.3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1)check_costar:			plays now sound when finished. Accepts now EQ, PS, QPS, Shooting, FGM to selectively test subgroups
2) Stability:			Changed order of variables in curve_container 
3) s_CON_gatekeeper:	mu_limit is now mandatory 
4) Solution:			Added the bifuraction table property (line 29); Added corresponding default allocation in constructor for the property
6) SOL_EQ:				Added bifurcation table update in the IF_arch_bfp_data
6) SOL_PS_Shoot:	    Added bifurcation table update in the IF_arch_bfp_data
6) SOL_PS_FGM:		    Added bifurcation table update in the IF_arch_bfp_data
7) ST_PS_Shoot:			Added message and info label for the bifuraction table corresponding to the test_functions
7) ST_EQ:				Added message and info label for the bifuraction table 
8) contplot:			Updated the contplot function: It plot bifurcation labels now and marks stable and unstable solution areas automatically

V2.3.2.3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1) Stability:			update_curve_container_bfp and clean_curve_container: sign function fo determination of stability change has been deleted, since it does not work  in the case for changing from n>0 to n>0+1
2) Solution:			Changed in all solution IF_arch_bfp_data: the number of unstable multipliers in the bifurcation point is now not 0 but identical to the number before the change.
3) test:				Added test_laval_EQ; Added RHS laval_eq; Changed name from benchmark_postprocess_eq to benchmark_postprocess_equilibrium and corrected the test filey;

V2.3.2.6
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1) Gatekeeper:			Changed the check_fields method so that is accepts cells of strings and not only structs.
2) s_help_xxx			Basically all classes and subclasses received s_help_xxx files. These files are declared static in the class description and are found autonomously by the 
						costarhelp class methods. 		
		
V2.3.2.7
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1) contplot:			Bug fix for label plotting of bifurcations: Now the correct label is plotted
	

V2.3.2.8
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1) ST_QPS_Shoot:		Line 38: Added the crit_multi method, which is required by the superclass.
						Added the corresponding crit_multi method
						s_stability_selection: Added if-statment: Stability cannot be computed for Fourier-Galerkin at the moment
						
2) check_costar:		Removed the option to supply a code path. Added the option to supply one or TWO code words
		

V2.3.2.8
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1) EQ_calc_stability:				Deleteted max_mult output and changed it to stabi_flag
									Added try and catch statement
2) check_stability_values:			Deleteted max_mult output. Input is now stabi_flag
3) PS_Shoot_calc_stability_auto:	Deleteted max_mult output and changed it to stability_flag
									Added try and catch statements; Deleted the last "if flag ..." statement
4) bifurcation_stability: 			Deleted the max_mult variable. Inserted the stabilit_flag statement
									Added if-statements to handle the case of a failure in the stability computation or the iteration of bifurcation point
									Changed the statement for the termination of the iteration loop to a difference in the multipliers
5) clean_curve_container:			Can now handle the case, when there was a failure in the compuation of a point or the stability. 
6) Continuation:					p_max_multiplier_bfp delted.
7) ALL SOL_classes:					Removed the max_multiplier from all archive methods
8) update_curve_container/_bfp:		Removed the max_multiplier from the function and the usage in the method.
9) identify_bifurcation:				Changed the call to the test_functions in the curve_container from 6 to 5.
10) get_stability_fcn:			     Changed the call to the test_functions in the curve_container from 6 to 5 and for the multipliers from 5 to 4
11) PS_Shoot_calc_stabilitynon_auto: Deleteted max_mult output and changed it to stability_flag
									 Added try and catch statements; Deleted the last "if flag ..." statement
12) QPS_Shoot_calc_stability: 		 Deleteted max_mult output and changed it to stability_flag
									 Added try and catch statements; Deleted the last "if flag ..." statement
									 Deleted the flag parameter and replaced it by the stability_flag statement


V2.3.2.10
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1) Repaired a bug in the display of bifurcation labels
2) Repaired a bug in the n_unstable computation: There was a sign command too much



V2.3.2.11
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1) cont and stability options changed from 1/0 to "on"/"off". I made the according changes in numerous subfiles.
2) error_control options changed from 1/0 to to "on"/"off". I made the according changes in numerous subfiles.

%%%%%%%%%%%% NEW CODE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
V2.3.2.1

ST_PS_Shooting:		Added PS_test_functions as a static method to the class (so that it can be called by the to-be-implemented ST_PS_Hill class)


V2.3.2.3
1) Stability:			Added the get_stability_fcn method for getting the test_function or multiplier from the curve_container, which had a zero crossing
						Added the identify_bifurcation method, which gives back a label and info message for the identified bifurcation

V2.3.2.6
1) costarhelp: 			The costarhelp class with a lot of mehtods was added. It serves as a universal help interface
